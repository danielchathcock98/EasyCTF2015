I tried searching for the string "easy" in the apple file to no avail. I can't find anything directly in the file....I don't like problems like this...

So...grep failed me. It turns out grep acts strangely with binary files (even with adding the -a flag or --binary-files=text flag). For apples it didn't output anything, but when I run
          strings apples.jpg | grep easy
it gave me the flag...so grep is imperfect!!

Problem was actually solved by Jake by doing an i-search in emacs
