I tried searching for the string "easy" in the apple file to no avail. I can't find anything directly in the file....I don't like problems like this...

So...grep failed me. It turns out grep acts strangely with binary files (even with adding the -a flag or --binary-files=text flag). For apples it didn't output anything, but when I run
          strings apples.jpg | grep easy
it gave me the flag...so grep is imperfect!!

Problem was actually solved by Jake by doing an i-search in emacs


After some research, I came across bgrep, which allows you to search for hex strings. Thus easy in hex is 65617379, so
     bgrep 65617379 apple.jpg
Then xxd command is hex dump, which lists off file as a bunch of hex, with the byte offset in increments of 16 (10 in hex), so
     xxd apples.jpg | grep 4b9250
Gace part of line, when the actual offset from bgrep was 4b925a (round down to 0)
