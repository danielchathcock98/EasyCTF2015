Again with the easy mode.

So, with this one, the thing is that they're using strcmp to compare your password, and they're looking to see if it's
equal to zero. The problem is, that's a crappy function to use, because, if you don't pass in 2 strings, it returns 0
So, you go into your beautiful URL, put some brackets next to "password=" to make it an array, and voila! you're in.
