So, I'll start off by asking: did someone say easy mode?

But on to the actual explantation.

So, if you open the site and actually try to go to the home or the about page, you see in the URL, that you are going
to "page=pages/index.html" or something like that. All you need to do is go and change the URL to say
"page=supersecretflag.txt", because that way you go around the permission problems. And yeah. Easy mode.
