This problem is a pretty simple programming problem. First parse file, remove the newline character at the end, and split into list by spaces.

Then, I made a short test for vowel or consonant, which then does the piglatin swap.

After that, its a simple problem of list comprehensions. Apply the function to each element of the input list.

Remember to add newline to end of output.
