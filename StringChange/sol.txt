I hate this stupid problem. The instructions/examples are wrong!! What the hell??...anyway...

Read file, separate two lines into list and string (which I make into a list to make mutable). Then do the changing (you can only change each letter once...which isn't specified anywhere, and is contradictory to the example). Then print as string.
